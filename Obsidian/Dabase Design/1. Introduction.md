## Designing a database


- Primary key - Unique key for each instance
- Foreign key - A primary key of another table
- Schema - A table with columns and no row values
	- Logical
		- Just names and conceptual
	- Physical
		- Column names with their data types
-  Any operation that happens should have a ==timestamp and a user stamp==
- Deleting any data is ==never== an option
- 


- No SQL Database
	- Fast
	- User for small, mobile applications
- Object Oriented Database
	- Similar to SQL Database
	- Based on a object of a class
	- Schema will be the classes
	- Each attribute of a class will be instated and is accessible to other classes
- Blockchain Database
	- Different data will be in different locations
	- Each sub-database block will work as a thread in the background
	- There is a central system that sends requests
- Graph Database
	- Has nodes and edges (may be directional)
	- 
- 
#### First collect ==information requirements==
> Defining what kind of information does the database store 
- Example
	- Keep track of which ==people== own which ==pets==
	- Capture the ==names== of the ==owners==
	- Capture the ==names== of the ==pets==
	- Store the ==photos== of the ==pets==
	- Store the ==addresses== where the ==pets== live
	- store a field which will determine what ==type== of ==animal== each ==pet== is

> A good start is to identify the nouns in the information requirements
- people, pets, names, owners, names, pets, photos, pets, addresses, pets, type, animal, pet

> It is better to get all the nouns into singular rather than plural
- person, pet, name, owner, name, pet, photo, pet, address, pet, type, animal, pet

> Get rid of redundant & duplicate words
- person, name, pet, photo, address, pet type

Entity relationship model (ERM)
Entity relationship diagram (ERD)

- Entity
	- State
	- Has stake (value & relationship)
	- 
- Steps to design ERM:
	1. Understand the requirements of the system 
	2. Choose a data model


## Types of schemas:
- Conceptual
	- Easy to modify
	- Less detail
	- Just the names
- Logical
	- Entity name?????
	- Have several tables and relationship concepts
- Physical
	- ERD
	- Data types
	- Final form of schema
