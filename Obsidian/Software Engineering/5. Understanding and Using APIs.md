### synchronous

-  first-come, first-served order
- enable the application to receive data immediately
- The application making the API request must wait for the response before performing any additional code execution tasks.
- 

### asynchronous
- request is an action that takes some time for the server to process
- request to server to start fetching data from some service
- an immediate response with data is not guaranteed.


### Common Architectural Styles
> RPC, SOAP, and REST.

- RPC: remote procedure call
	- often synchronous meaning client process waits (blocks) for the response from server process and then after getting the response it unblocks -> continues working
	- application (client) --> call --> application (server) - this one has the desired method
	- client doesn't know the call is happening remotely
	- client app just runs the function with arguments 
	- applicible to different transport protocols including below:
		- XML-RPC
		- JSON-RPC
		- NFS (Network File System)
		- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
- SOAP: 
	- messaging protocol
	- built by Microsoft
	- communication using xml in different platforms (mobile/desktop or mac/windows)
	- commonly used with HTTP
	- Main characteristics:
		- Independent
			- Different platforms can use
			- Stateless
			- Regardless of OS or programming language
		- Extensible
			- because of it's XML architecture, devs can use SOAP with their extra layers of security and reliability layers
		- Neutreal:
			- can be used over any protocol (almost)
	- Message example body:
		- Envelope: must be root element, namespace tells  XML doc is a SOAP message
		- Header: optional, if exists: first child of namespace, includes app-specific information like authorization info and others
		- Body: in its own namespace, transport data must be XML message
		- Fault: optional, if exists: first child of body, tells about errors
	- Message example:
	```
		<?xml version="1.0"?>
		
		<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
		
		    <soap:Header/>
		
		    <soap:Body>
		
		        <soap:Fault>
		
		            <faultcode>soap:Server</faultcode>
		
		            <faultstring>Query request too large.</faultstring>
		
		        </soap:Fault>
		
		    </soap:Body>
		
		</soap:Envelope>
	```

- REST: Representational state transfer
	- six elements of architecture:
		- Client-Server
		- Stateless
		- Cache
		- Uniform Interface
		- Layered System
		- Code-On-Demand
	- Header types
		- Request headers
			- Request headers include additional information that doesn't relate to the content of the message.
		- Entity headers
			- Entity headers are additional information that describe the content of the body of the message.
	- Body
		- if body exists, data type is defined in header as `content-type` key
		- **pagination** is used when the data is big and will be sent in chunks, it is mostly used via query parameters specifying how many records should be send per response
		- **compressed data**: 
			- the client application can specify the data to be compressed through the request itself by having the  `Content-Encoding` Field in the request header
			- possible encoding types:
				- gzip
				- compress
				- deflate
				- br
				- identity
				- *
			- if encoding type is not possible
				- server will return 406 -- Not acceptable status code
				-
