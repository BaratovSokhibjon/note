	- PC: End device  
	- Router: Forwards data between networks  
	- Switch: Connects devices within a network  
	- Hub: Broadcasts data to all devices  
	- Hosts: clients and servers (often in data centers)


- Internet standards - Formats for protocols
	- REC: Request for Comments
	- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
	- W3C: World Wide Web Consortium

- ### Access Networks
	- **Cable-based**:
		- FDM: Frequency Network Multiplexing
			- different channels are transmitted in different frequency bands

			- asymmetric: up to 40Mbps - 1.2 Gbps downstream transmission rate, 30-100Mbps upstream transmission rate
	
	- **DSL**: Digital subscriber Line
		- use existing telephone line 
		- data > DSL phone line > internet
		- voice > DSL phone line > telephone net
		- 24-52Mbps downstream
		- 3.5-16Mbps upstream
	
	- **Home Networks**:
		- Wireless Local Area Networks
			- around building
			- 802.11b/g/n (WiFi): 11, 54, 450 Mbps
		- Wide-area Cellular Access Networks
			- by mobile, cellular network
			- 10Mbps
			- 4G/5G cellular networks
	
	- **Enterprise Networks:**
		- companies, universities etc
		- mix of mediums, routers and switches
	
	- **Data Centers**:
		- high-bandwidth links (10-100Gbps)
		- thousands of servers connected 


- ### Links:
- **Physical Media (Guided Media):**  
	- Twisted Pair (TP): Copper, two-string  
		- RJ-45: Connector for TP  
			- CAT5: Up to 100 Mbps  
		    -  CAT6: Up to 10 Gbps  
		    
	    - Coaxial Cable: 
		    - Two concentric copper conductors 
			- Bidirectional, broadband  
			- Multiple frequency channels (up to 100 Mbps/channel)  
			
	    - Fiber Optic Cable: Glass fiber, light pulses (1 bit/pulse)  
		    - High-speed: 10-100 Gbps (point-to-point)  
		    -  Low error rate: Immune to electromagnetic interference, repeaters far apart  
		
- **Wireless (Unguided Media):**  
	- Wireless Radio: Uses electromagnetic spectrum bands  
	    - No wires, broadcast or directed  
		  - Types:  
	        - Wireless LAN: 10-100 Mbps (e.g., Wi-Fi)  
	        - Wide Area: 4G/5G cellular (Mbps to Gbps)  
	        - Bluetooth: Short-range, limited (up to 3 Mbps)  
	        - Satellite: Uplink/downlink, delay (ms), noise  
	        - Terrestrial Microwave: Line-of-sight, high-frequency (up to 100 Mbps)  
	        
		  - Modes:  
	        - Simplex: One-way (e.g., radio)  
	        - Half-Duplex: Bidirectional, one at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie)  
	        - Full-Duplex: Simultaneous bidirectional (e.g., phone)  

- ### Network Core:  
	-  Two Core Functions:  
	    - Forwarding: Local action, decides output port for data  
	    - Routing: Global action, determines best path for data  
	    
	- Routing Algorithms:  
	  - Adapting: Adjusts to network changes  
	  - Non-Adapting: Fixed paths, no adjustments  
	    
	  - Packet Switches: 
		- Devices: routers/switches
	    - Process: Inspect packet headers, decide next hop  
	    - Transfer: Variable, depends on link (e.g., 64 bytes to 1500 bytes/packet)  
	    - Function: Forward packets by deciding next hop
		
	  - Routing Protocols: 
		- Rules to determine packet paths
	    - Decision: Based on destination IP, routing tables  
	    
		- OSPF: Open Shortest Path First
		    - within a single network
		    - decide the fastest way to send data
		    - It’s like a GPS for routers.
		
		- BGP: Border Gateway Protocol
			- manages how data travels between your internet provider and Google’s servers ( Different networks )
			- It’s the “postal service” of the internet.
			- Handles the massive scale of the internet.
			- Slower to update than OSPF but more flexible for big, messy networks.
	
	  - Switching:  
		  - Packet-Switching:  
		    - Shared resource, data divided into packets  
		    - Routing not predetermined  
		    - Queuing: Occurs when data arrives faster than serviced 
		    - Loss: If arrival rate exceeds transmission rate for some period of time

		  - Circuit-Switching:  
		    - Private resource, route predetermined  
		    - Circuit reserved, blocked for duration  
		    - No latency once connected  
		    
		    - FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing):  
		    -  Analog signals, optical/electromagnetic frequencies  
		    -  Divided into narrow frequency bands (e.g., 4 users, 4 frequencies)  
		    
			- TDM (Time Division Multiplexing):  
		    -  Digital signals, time divided into slots  
		    -  Data split across time (e.g., 4 users, 4 time slots)

- ### Network of Networks
	- Connect Hosts via ISPs
	- Connect ISPs via regional ISPs
	- Connect regional ISPs via Global ISPs
		- There are several different ISPs
	- Connect Global ISPs via IXPs (Service) or *peering link* (general agreement) for reducing latency

> [!NOTE] Info
> There are **Content provider networks** like Google that run their own network over internet.
