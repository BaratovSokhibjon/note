### Transport Layer
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

#### TCP
- Stateful for tracking communication data
- it tracks what portion of the info has been sent and acknowledged
- it starts the session with creation and ends it with termination
- TCP header segment adds extra 20bytes

| **TCP Header Field**   | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source Port           | A 16-bit field used to identify the source application by port number.         |
| Destination Port      | A 16-bit field used to identify the destination application by port number.    |
| Sequence Number       | A 32-bit field used for data reassembly purposes.                              |
| Acknowledgment Number | A 32-bit field used to indicate that data has been received and the next byte expected from the source. |
| Header Length         | A 4-bit field known as “data offset” that indicates the length of the TCP segment header. |
| Reserved              | A 6-bit field that is reserved for future use.                                 |
| Control Bits          | A 6-bit field that includes bit codes, or flags, which indicate the purpose and function of the TCP segment. |
| Window Size           | A 16-bit field used to indicate the number


### UDP - User Datagram protocol

- it is simpler than TCP since it has less header fields
- it divides data into datagram which it refers to as segments
- stateless and connection-less protocol, it does not require established connection. stateless bc neither client nor server tracks the state of the message sent or received
- there are no transport layer processes that inform the sender of successful delivery and that is why it is also called as **best-effort delivery protocol**
- perfect for low-priority voice or video stream

#### UDP header
 - 8 bytes

| **UDP Header Field** | **Description**                                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source Port         | A 16-bit field used to identify the source application by port number. |
| Destination Port    | A 16-bit field used to identify the destination application by port number. |
| Length              | A 16-bit field that indicates the length of the UDP datagram header. |
| Checksum            | A 16-bit field used for error checking of the datagram header and data. |


### Session establishment

The six control bits flags are as follows:
- **URG** - Urgent pointer field significant
- **ACK** - Acknowledgment flag used in connection establishment and session termination
- **PSH** - Push function
- **RST** - Reset the connection when an error or timeout occurs
- **SYN** - Synchronize sequence numbers used in connection establishment
- **FIN** - No more data from sender and used in session termination

#### Connection establishment: three-way handshake

- **Step 1: SYN (A → B)**
  - A sends SYN (SEQ=100, CTL=SYN).
  - Requests client-to-server session.
  - B receives SYN.

- **Step 2: SYN-ACK (B → A)**
  - B sends SYN-ACK (SEQ=300, ACK=101, CTL=SYN,ACK).
  - Acknowledges A’s request, requests server-to-client session.
  - A receives, confirms B’s availability.

- **Step 3: ACK (A → B)**
  - A sends ACK (SEQ=101, ACK=301, CTL=ACK).
  - Confirms server-to-client session.
  - Connection established.

- **Outcome**
  - A and B ready for data exchange.
  - Sequence numbers set for reliable transfer.

#### TCP Connection Termination (Four-Way Handshake)

- **Overview**
  - Terminates TCP connection between client (A) and server (B).
  - Uses FIN and ACK flags to close both directions of communication.

- **Step 1: FIN (A → B)**
  - A sends FIN to B.
  - Indicates no more data to send (client-to-server).

- **Step 2: ACK (B → A)**
  - B sends ACK to A.
  - Acknowledges receipt of FIN, closes client-to-server session.

- **Step 3: FIN (B → A)**
  - B sends FIN to A.
  - Indicates no more data to send (server-to-client).

- **Step 4: ACK (A → B)**
  - A sends ACK to B.
  - Acknowledges receipt of FIN, closes server-to-client session.

- **Outcome**
  - Connection fully terminated in both directions.

# Principles of reliable data transfer
- reliablse serveice abstraction:
	- data should be sent via reliable channel
