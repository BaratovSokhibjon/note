### ICMPv4 Messages

> Although IP is only a best-effort protocol, the TCP/IP suite does provide for messages to be sent in the event of certain errors. These messages are sent using the services of ICMP.

ICMP messages common to both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 include:
- Host confirmation
- Destination or Service Unreachable
- Time exceeded
- Route redirection

#### ICMPv4
When the gateway is not reachable we get error codes as below: 
- **0** - Net unreachable
- **1** - Host unreachable
- **2** - Protocol unreachable
- **3** - Port unreachable
- **Time exceeded** - the Time to Live (TTL) field of the packet was decremented to 0

> [!NOTE] Note
> ICMPv6 has similar but slightly different codes for Destination Unreachable messages.


#### ICMPv6
- ICMPv6 includes four new protocols as part of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND or NDP).

Messaging between an IPv6 router and an IPv6 device:
- Router Solicitation (RS) message
- Router Advertisement (RA) message

Messaging between IPv6 devices:
- Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message
- Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message


ICMP uses message codes to differentiate between different types of ICMP messages. These are some common message codes:

- **0** - Echo reply (response to a ping)
- **3** - Destination Unreachable
- **5** - Redirect (use another route to your destination)
- **8** - Echo request (for ping)
- **11** - Time Exceeded (TTL became 0)
