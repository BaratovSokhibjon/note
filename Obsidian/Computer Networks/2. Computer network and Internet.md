### OSI reference model

- It provides more functionalities at each layer 
- consistent in all types of network protocols 

| Layer             | Description                                                                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### TCP/IP protocol suite

![[Pasted image 20250405111818.png]]

*TCP/IP is the protocol suite used by the internet and the networks of today. TCP/IP has two important aspects for vendors and manufacturers:*

- ***Open standard protocol suite** - This means it is freely available to the public and can be used by any vendor on their hardware or in their software.*
- ***Standards-based protocol suite** - This means it has been endorsed by the networking industry and approved by a standards organization. This ensures that products from different manufacturers can interoperate successfully.*


### **Application Layer**

Name System

- **DNS** - Domain Name System. Translates domain names such as cisco.com, into IP addresses.

Host Config

- **DHCPv4** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4. A DHCPv4 server dynamically assigns IPv4 addressing information to DHCPv4 clients at start-up and allows the addresses to be re-used when no longer needed.
- **DHCPv6** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6. DHCPv6 is similar to DHCPv4. A DHCPv6 server dynamically assigns IPv6 addressing information to DHCPv6 clients at start-up.
- **SLAAC** - Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. A method that allows a device to obtain its IPv6 addressing information without using a DHCPv6 server.

Email

- **SMTP** - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Enables clients to send email to a mail server and enables servers to send email to other servers.
- **POP3** - Post Office Protocol version 3. Enables clients to retrieve email from a mail server and download the email to the client's local mail application.
- **IMAP** - Internet Message Access Protocol. Enables clients to access email stored on a mail server as well as maintaining email on the server.

File Transfer

- **FTP** - File Transfer Protocol. Sets the rules that enable a user on one host to access and transfer files to and from another host over a network. FTP is a reliable, connection-oriented, and acknowledged file delivery protocol.
- **SFTP** - SSH File Transfer Protocol. As an extension to Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, SFTP can be used to establish a secure file transfer session in which the file transfer is encrypted. SSH is a method for secure remote login that is typically used for accessing the command line of a device.
- **TFTP** - Trivial File Transfer Protocol. A simple, connectionless file transfer protocol with best-effort, unacknowledged file delivery. It uses less overhead than FTP.

Web and Web Service

- **HTTP** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol. A set of rules for exchanging text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files on the World Wide Web.
- **HTTPS** - HTTP Secure. A secure form of HTTP that encrypts the data that is exchanged over the World Wide Web.
- **REST** - Representational State Transfer. A web service that uses application programming interfaces (APIs) and HTTP requests to create web applications.



### **Transport layer**

Connection-Oriented

- **TCP** - Transmission Control Protocol. Enables reliable communication between processes running on separate hosts and provides reliable, acknowledged transmissions that confirm successful delivery.

Connectionless

- **UDP** - User Datagram Protocol. Enables a process running on one host to send packets to a process running on another host. However, UDP does not confirm successful datagram transmission.



### **Internet Layer**

Internet Protocol

- **IPv4** - Internet Protocol version 4. Receives message segments from the transport layer, packages messages into packets, and addresses packets for end-to-end delivery over a network. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address.
- **IPv6** - IP version 6. Similar to IPv4 but uses a 128-bit address.
- **NAT** - Network Address Translation. Translates IPv4 addresses from a private network into globally unique public IPv4 addresses.

Messaging

- **ICMPv4** - Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv4. Provides feedback from a destination host to a source host about errors in packet delivery.
- **ICMPv6** - ICMP for IPv6. Similar functionality to ICMPv4 but is used for IPv6 packets.
- **ICMPv6 ND** - ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery. Includes four protocol messages that are used for address resolution and duplicate address detection.

Routing Protocols

- **OSPF** - Open Shortest Path First. Link-state routing protocol that uses a hierarchical design based on areas. OSPF is an open standard interior routing protocol.
- **EIGRP** - EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol. An open standard routing protocol developed by Cisco that uses a composite metric based on bandwidth, delay, load and reliability.
- **BGP** - Border Gateway Protocol. An open standard exterior gateway routing protocol used between Internet Service Providers (ISPs). BGP is also commonly used between ISPs and their large private clients to exchange routing information.



### **Network Access Layer**

Address Resolution

- **ARP** - Address Resolution Protocol. Provides dynamic address mapping between an IPv4 address and a hardware address.
    
    **Note:** You may see other documentation state that ARP operates at the Internet Layer (OSI Layer 3). However, in this course we state that ARP operates at the Network Access layer (OSI Layer 2) because it's primary purpose is the discover the MAC address of the destination. A MAC address is a Layer 2 address.
    

Data Link Protocols

- **Ethernet** - Defines the rules for wiring and signaling standards of the network access layer.
- **WLAN** - Wireless Local Area Network. Defines the rules for wireless signaling across the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio frequencies.

### Unicast, multicast, broadcast

- **Unicast**
	- A one-to-one delivery option is referred to as a unicast, meaning there is only a single destination for the message.
- Multicast
	- When a host needs to send messages using a one-to-many delivery option, it is referred to as a multicast.
- Broadcast
	- If all hosts on the network need to receive the message at the same time, a broadcast may be used. Broadcasting represents a one-to-all message delivery option.



### Data encapsulation

#### Segmentation
- process of dividing data into small packets and sending them over different routes
	- this was introduced because large files would crash and the file wouldn't be transmitted if connection is lost from the receiving end
	- less delays when transmitting large files
	- allows to send different user data across the same channel (multiplexing)

#### Sequencing
- when the packets are segmented the TCP/IP is responsible for assigning them indexes to make sure that successful de-encapsulation is possible
	- Multiple pieces are labeled for easy direction and  re-assembly.
	- Labeling provides for ordering and assembling the pieces when they arrive.

### Protocol Data Units (PDU)
**The form that a piece of data takes at any layer**

The form that a piece of data takes at any layer is called a protocol data unit (PDU). During encapsulation, each succeeding layer encapsulates the PDU that it receives from the layer above in accordance with the protocol being used. At each stage of the process, a PDU has a different name to reflect its new functions. Although there is no universal naming convention for PDUs, in this course, the PDUs are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite. The PDUs for each form of data are shown in the figure.


> [!NOTE] Note
> Although the UDP PDU is called datagram, IP packets are sometimes also referred to as IP datagrams.

![[Pasted image 20250405114131.png]]

- Data - The general term for the PDU used at the application layer
- Segment - Transport layer PDU
- Packet - Network layer PDU
- Frame - Data Link layer PDU
- Bits - Physical layer PDU used when physically transmitting data over the medium


> [!NOTE] Note
> If the Transport header is TCP, then it is a segment. If the Transport header is UDP then it is a datagram.


### Networking Basics on an Ethernet LAN
1. **Addresses**
   - **Physical Address (MAC Address)**
     - Definition: Unique 48-bit identifier for a device’s NIC or a network interface card.
     - Purpose: Used at Layer 2 for NIC-to-NIC communication on the same LAN.
     - Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.
   - **Logical Address (IP Address)**
     - Definition: 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) number assigned to a device.
     - Purpose: Identifies source and destination at Layer 3, across networks.
     - Example: 192.168.1.10.

### ARP - Address Resolution Protocol

- ARP provides two basic functions:
	- Resolving IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses
	- Maintaining a table of IPv4 to MAC address mappings

- Every ethernet has a unique MAC address
- when a device sends a layer 2 frame it uses:
	- Destination MAC address
		- on the same network: NIC of recieving device
		- on different network: MAC address of default gateway (eg. router)
	- Source MAC address 
- ARP requests are **BROADCAST**

> When a packet is sent to the data link layer to be encapsulated into an Ethernet frame, the device refers to a table in its memory to find the MAC address that is mapped to the IPv4 address. This table is stored temporarily in RAM memory and called the ARP table or the ARP cache.

#### ARP Table
- A table that stores two values map of IP addresses and their corresponding MAC values
- It is temporarily stored in cache
- If no corresponding MAC address for an IP, the device **sends and ARP request**
- The cache is removed in specific periods of time depending on the OS:
	- Windows: 15 - 45 seconds

#### ARP Request
- ARP messages are encapsulated in the Ethernet frame in data link layer
- There is no IPv4 header, instead it is in Ethernet frame as below:
	- **Destination MAC address** - This is a broadcast address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF requiring all Ethernet NICs on the LAN to accept and process the ARP request.
	- **Source MAC address** - This is MAC address of the sender of the ARP request.
	- **Type** - ARP messages have a type field of 0x806. This informs the receiving NIC that the data portion of the frame needs to be passed to the ARP process.

### ARP Reply
- encapsulated in ethernet frame with below information:
	- **Destination MAC address** - This is the MAC address of the sender of the ARP request.
	- **Source MAC address** - This is the MAC address of the sender of the ARP reply.
	- **Type** - ARP messages have a type field of 0x806. This informs the receiving NIC that the data portion of the frame needs to be passed to the ARP process.
- device that send ARP request will get the ARP reply and add it to the ARP table
- if ARP reply cannot find the device, the packet will be dropped


> [!NOTE] **Note**
>  IPv6 uses a similar process to ARP for IPv4, known as ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND). IPv6 uses neighbor solicitation and neighbor advertisement messages, similar to IPv4 ARP requests and ARP replies.


ARP Issues:
- The effect of ARP requests are minimal as long as a lot of devices do not connect at the same time
- The effect of ARP requests will be even less after each device gets to know the MAC address of each IP
- **Thread:** a thread actor can send ARP reply to the ARP request that was sent to a different device by having the destination IP address in ARP reply and send it to the requesting device, which would make the packets to be transfered to different device. To handle this dynamic ARP inspection or DAI techniques are used.
