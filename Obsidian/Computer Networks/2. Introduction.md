- **MAN**: Metropolitan Area Network (city-sized)  
- **ARPANet**: First network, military-built (Internet precursor)  

- **Network Types**:  
  - LAN: Local Area Network (small, e.g., office)  
  - WAN: Wide Area Network (large, e.g., global)  
  - MAN: (as above)  

- **Nodes (Devices)**:  
  - PC: End device  
  - Router: Forwards between networks  
  - Switch: Connects within network  
  - Hub: Broadcasts data  

- **Protocols**:  
  - IP: Addressing, routing  
  - FTP: File sharing  
  - RTSP: Media streaming  
  - HTTP: Web browsing  
  - TCP: Reliable data transfer  
  - UDP: Fast, unreliable transfer  
  - DNS: Name-to-IP translation  

- **Medium**:  
  - Twisted Pair: Copper, two-string (e.g., Ethernet)  
  - Fiber Optic: Light-based, high-speed  
  - Wireless: Radio waves (e.g., Wi-Fi)  
  - Coaxial: Older cable  

- **Addresses**:  
  - MAC Address: Physical, fixed (48-bit)  
  - IP Address: Logical, dynamic (IPv4: 32-bit, IPv6: 128-bit)  

- **OSI Model**:  
  1. Physical: Cables, signals  
  2. Data Link: MAC, switches  
  3. Network: IP, routers  
  4. Transport: TCP/UDP  
  5. Session: Connection control  
  6. Presentation: Data format  
  7. Application: HTTP, FTP  

- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Packet: Data unit  
  - Bandwidth: Transfer rate (e.g., Mbps)  
  - Latency: Transmission delay
